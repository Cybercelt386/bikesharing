#Citi bike analysis and conclusions

##Overview:
Utilizing data from Citi bike users I  aim to interpret the best way to customize the Citi bike service to fulfill the demands of users the data gathered includes start and stop times, number of bikes used, gender, days of the week bike were used, and the duration of the trip. 

##Analysis:
Filtering data by multiple of the afore mention groups my goal is to determine what days the bikes are utilized the longest and by what gender groups this will give Citi bike  information it can use about how to aim is marketing and advertising strategy. The longer bikes are rented the more money Citi bike generates should Citi bike aim its market towards primarily male or female groups and what days should it have the most bikes available and what days would be the best time to perform maintenance on the bikes.

##Results:
Based on these heat maps we can see that the greatest number of bikes taken out are on Thursdays  by primarily male users. Male users also tend to rent for longer than female users with the longest trips happening on Thursdays and Fridays. Therefore, Citi bike should market its products primarily  towards the  male subscribers  looking to go biking on Thursdays and Fridays.
